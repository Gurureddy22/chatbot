# Customer Support Chatbot

A **Customer Support Chatbot** is a virtual assistant that uses predefined rules or AI to handle customer inquiries, understanding questions and providing instant answers. This project implements such a chatbot with a Python (Flask) backend and a web-based frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). The bot loads a pretrained intent-classification model and response dataset, allowing it to classify user queries and return a relevant answer. It also integrates Google Translate to support multiple input/output languages, enhancing accessibility across different locales.
